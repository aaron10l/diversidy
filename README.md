# Diversidy - Investment Portfolio Diversification Tool

Welcome to Diversidy!

**<u>[www.diversidy.com]</u>**

Diversidy is a web application **in beta** that allows users to view and analyze the diversification of their investment portfolio across multiple brokerages. With Diversidy, you can easily see how your investments are distributed among different asset classes, sectors, and geographies, and determine if your portfolio is adequately diversified to meet your financial goals.

## Getting Started

To get started with Diversidy, you will need to create a beta tester account and connect it to the brokerages where you hold your investments. Diversidy currently supports the following brokerages:

- TD Ameritrade
- Charles Schwab
- E*Trade by Morgan Stanley

Once you have connected your brokerages, Diversidy will automatically import your investment data and present it in an easy-to-understand dashboard. From the dashboard, you can view your portfolio's diversification across various metrics, including asset allocation, sector allocation, and geographic allocation.

## Additional Tools

In addition to the dashboard, Diversidy also offers a number of tools to help you analyze and optimize your portfolio's diversification. These tools include:

- A portfolio simulator that allows you to see how changes to your portfolio's asset allocation would affect its risk and return.
- A risk analysis tool that helps you understand the risks associated with your portfolio and how they are distributed among different asset classes.
- A portfolio optimization tool that suggests a more diversified portfolio based on your financial goals and risk tolerance.
